Data Science for Food and Health MSc	Wageningen University & Research	Social Sciences	0.0	Data are everywhere: from sensors and trackers, to apps measuring the behaviour of people. The use of data science offers new opportunities in the domains of health, nutrition, lifestyle and consumer behaviour. We can use data science to better measure and understand what and how people eat. What food choices do they make? And what is the relation between lifestyle and human health? You will be able to integrate data science knowledge and skills with a sound understanding of nutrition, consumer behaviour and lifestyles, and their effects on human health. After graduation, a data scientist in Food and Health will have a solid knowledge base, as well as excellent connecting skills.
