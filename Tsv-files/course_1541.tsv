Biomedical Science (Medical Microbiology) MSc/PGCert	Middlesex University	Faculty of Science and Technology	Part Time	Microbiology is the study of the millions of micro-organisms with which we share our world, dealing with those that cause disease and making use of those of benefit to us. It's a fascinating subject as identifying dangerous microbes, stopping their spread and treating their effects is vital and often life-saving work. This is a particularly pertinent subject to consider studying in light of the global pandemic and prospective diseases and zoonosis that are increasingly prevalent.
