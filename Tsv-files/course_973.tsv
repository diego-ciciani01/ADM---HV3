Agricultural Economics	Harper Adams University	Postgraduate study at Harper Adams	Part Time	Food crises, commodity price booms and busts, environmental concerns and trade tensions are just some of the focuses of the analysis undertaken in agricultural economics. Agricultural economics concerns itself with the study of the production and consumption of food in both developed and developing countries along with analysis of the policies that shape the world's largest industry. This programme is a much applied field covering many topics beyond those stereotypically thought of as pertaining to agriculture. These may include finance and risk management, environmental and natural resource economics, game theory, or public policy analysis.
