Financial & Computational Mathematics MSc	University College Cork	College of Science, Engineering and Food Science	Part Time	Our postgraduate Financial and Computational Mathematics programme equips graduates in mathematics, physics, or engineering with the skills necessary to pursue a successful career in quantitative finance. Modern financial technology is based upon sophisticated computational techniques for the modelling of asset and market movements, and the valuation of financial derivatives. Employers actively seek graduates with an understanding of the mathematical background as well as the computational skills needed to apply it; this course provides a solid grounding in both these disciplines and includes a team-based research project with opportunities to work in partnership with the industry.
