MSc Food Safety	University College Dublin	UCD School of Agriculture and Food Science	0.0	Graduate Taught (level 9 nfq, credits 90)As the global population increases, creating a demand for even more food, producing safe food has never been as important. Many of us are in the lucky position that we can say we get to eat something everyday, and ideally, that food which we eat should not make us sick or cause us to feel unwell. Put simply: ‘If it isn’t safe, it isn’t food!’.	September	MSc	2 years Part-Time	FeesPlease see the university website for further information on fees for this course.
