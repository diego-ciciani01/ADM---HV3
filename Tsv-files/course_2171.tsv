Computational Architecture - MSc	University of the West of England, Bristol	Department of Architecture and the Built Environment	0.0	When an architectural problem needs solving, architects use biological and mathematical models to simulate the problem. Applying these algorithms to simulations allows architects to experiment with design solutions in a studio environment.Modelling is crucial for us to create spaces that support the social and biological systems in society. Explore the natural and built environment, designing spaces to enhance these settings while tackling industry challenges, such as sustainability.An experimental	September	MSc	1 year full-time, 2 years part-time	FeesFull time Home Award Fee £9000 Home Module Fee (15 Credit) £750  Part time Home Module Fee (15 Credit) £750 Offshore Module Fee (15 Credit) £1188	United Kingdom	Bristol	On Campus	https://www.findamasters.com/masters-degrees/course/computational-architecture-msc/?i359d4468c65801
