Ecology and Urban Engineering MSc	University College London	Division of Biosciences	Part Time	Register your interest in graduate study at UCLThe MSc in Ecology and Urban Engineering will equip you with the tools to design spaces that work with and for nature, bridging the gap between ecosystems and the artificial landscape. You will learn how to shape our surroundings and how to design and build urban spaces for biodiversity benefits.About this degreeThe interface between planners, architects, engineers, and ecologists is rarely integrated or trans-disciplinary. Yet the need to develop capacity to assimilate natural capital in ways that provide long-term, sustainable benefits is paramount, and requires ecological literacy in areas of expertise traditionally lacking in these skills.
