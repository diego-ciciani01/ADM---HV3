Erasmus Mundus Master of Science in Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (Leuven)	KU Leuven	Faculty of Engineering Science	0.0	The word Nanoscience refers to the study, manipulation and engineering of matter, particles and structures on the nanometer scale. Important properties of materials, such as the electrical, optical, thermal and mechanical properties, are determined by the way molecules and atoms assemble on the nanoscale into larger structures. Nanotechnology is the application of nanoscience leading to the use of new nanomaterials and nanosize components in useful products.
