Master of Science in Machine Learning	Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence	Masters Programmes	Part Time	IntroductionThe scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to effectively perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. These algorithms are based on mathematical models learned automatically from data, thus allowing machines to intelligently interpret and analyze input data to derive useful knowledge and arrive at important conclusions. Machine learning is heavily used for enterprise applications (e.g., business intelligence and analytics), effective web search, robotics, smart cities and understanding of the human genomeProgram CompetenceUpon completion of the program requirements, the graduate will be able to:	See Course	MSc	12 months	FeesPlease see the university website for further information on fees for this course.
