Atmospheric Sciences - MSc (Agriculture and Forestry)	University of Helsinki	International Masters Degree Programmes	0.0	Goal of the pro­grammeSociety urgently needs experts with a multidisciplinary education in atmospheric and Earth System sciences. Climate change, urban air quality and extreme weather are matters of global concern which science cannot yet completely explain. Thus, more scientific research needs to be made. Environmental specialists are also needed in companies ranging from clean technology to energy and insurance, as well as among policy makers and governments. ATM-MP educates all meteorologists in Finland for weather forecasting, meteorological research and aviation safety. We also educate hydrospheric geophysicists to work in the fields of cryology, hydrology and oceanography, and chemists and aerosol physicists to work in companies.
