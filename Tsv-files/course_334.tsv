MSc in Medical Physics with Radiobiology	University of Oxford	Department of Oncology	0.0	The MSc in Medical Physics with Radiobiology is a one-year, full-time course run by the Department of Oncology at the University of Oxford, delivered by world-leading academics and clinical scientists.The main aim of this course is to discuss how ionising and non-ionising radiation are used in clinical practice, both in the context of radiotherapy and medical imaging. This is combined with principles of radiobiology at molecular and cellular level, to give graduates a better understanding of the effects of radiation than is achieved in other medical physics courses.
